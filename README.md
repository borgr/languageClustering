# languageClustering
The aim of this project is to compare various phonemic based automatic methods to help us better understand at least the phonetic aspects we rely upon or should rely upon when we make the decisions about language families.

There are two main experiments in this project, feature selection for classifying language families and language families clustering by various matrics.
